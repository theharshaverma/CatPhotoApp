# HTML Tags & Cat Photo App

Welcome to the **HTML Tags & Cat Photo App** repository! This project is designed to help you learn the most common HTML tags by building a simple and fun cat photo app.

## 📌 About This Project

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development. It provides the structure for web pages by defining elements like text, images, buttons, and more. This project will introduce you to fundamental HTML tags while creating a webpage dedicated to cat photos.

## 🏗️ What You Will Learn

By working on this project, you will gain hands-on experience with:

- Structuring a webpage using HTML tags
- Adding images using the `<img>` tag
- Creating buttons using the `<button>` tag
- Using headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) and paragraphs (`<p>`) for text
- Organizing content with `<div>` and `<section>` elements
- Creating lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) for better content organization
- Adding links using the `<a>` tag
